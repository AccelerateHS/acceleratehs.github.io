Libraries
=========

Some additional libraries we maintain for working with Accelerate.

  * [accelerate-io](/libraries/accelerate-io.html): Fast conversion between
    Accelerate arrays and other array formats, including [vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector) and [repa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa),
    as well as reading and writing arrays as [BMP images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format).

  * [accelerate-fft](/libraries/accelerate-fft.html): Discrete Fourier
    transforms, with FFI bindings to optimised external implementations for both
    the CPU and GPU.

  * [colour-accelerate](/libraries/colour-accelerate.html): Colour
    representations in Accelerate, including [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model), [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB), [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), and [HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV).
    Also includes 191 predefined, named colours.

  * [lens-accelerate](/libraries/lens-accelerate.html):
    [Lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) operators for Accelerate
    types, in particular useful for accessing components of tuples and other
    product types.

  * [linear-accelerate](/libraries/linear-accelerate.html): Types and combinators for working with the
    [linear](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear) package in Accelerate.

  * [gloss-accelerate](/libraries/gloss-accelerate.html): Generate [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) pictures from Accelerate.

  * [gloss-raster-accelerate](/libraries/gloss-raster-accelerate.html): Parallel rendering of raster images and
    animations with [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss).

  * [mwc-random-accelerate](/libraries/mwc-random-accelerate.html): Generate
    Accelerate arrays filled with high quality pseudorandom numbers
