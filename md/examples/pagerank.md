# PageRank

A simplified version of the [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank),
a link analysis algorithm which assigns a numerical weighting to each element of
a hyperlinked set of documents, with the purpose of determining the relative
importance of each document within that set. PageRank was developed at Google as
a method for measuring the importance of website pages.
