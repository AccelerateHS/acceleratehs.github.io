Publications
============

If you use Accelerate for academic research, you are encouraged (though
certainly not required) to cite the following papers, which explain various
aspects of the system. In reverse chronological order:

  * Trevor L. McDonell, Manuel M. T. Chakravarty, Vinod Grover, and Ryan R. Newton.<br>
    Type-safe Runtime Code Generation: Accelerate to LLVM.<br>
    In _Haskell '15: The 8th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Haskell_, ACM, 2015.

  * Robert Clifton-Everest, Trevor L. McDonell, Manuel M. T. Chakravarty, and Gabriele Keller.<br>
    Embedding Foreign Code.<br>
    In _PADL '14: The 16th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages_, Springer-Verlag, LNCS, 2014.

  * Trevor L. McDonell, Manuel M. T. Chakravarty, Gabriele Keller, and Ben Lippmeier.<br>
    Optimising Purely Functional GPU Programs.<br>
    In _ICFP '13: The 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming_, ACM, 2013.

  * Manuel M. T. Chakravarty, Gabriele Keller, Sean Lee, Trevor L. McDonell, and Vinod Grover.<br>
    Accelerating Haskell Array Codes with Multicore GPUs.<br>
    In _DAMP '11: Declarative Aspects of Multicore Programming_, ACM, 2011.

Accelerate is primarily developed by academics, so citations matter a lot to us.
As an added benefit, you increase Accelerate's exposure and potential user (and
developer!) base, which is a benefit to all users of Accelerate. Thanks in
advance!
