Community
=========

Accelerate is an open-source research compiler project which we aim to make
useful for real applications, so always enjoy hearing from our users. There are
several ways you can interact and collaborate with us and other Accelerate users
around the world.

## Contact

These are places to ask questions, to learn, to teach, and to find other users
and collaborators:

  * [Accelerate mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/accelerate-haskell)

  * [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues)

  * Contact the maintainers [Trevor L. McDonell](mailto:tmcdonell@cse.unsw.edu.au)
    and [Manual M T Chakravarty](mailto:chak@cse.unsw.edu.au) directly.


## Get Involved

There are many ways you can help us to improve Accelerate:

  * **Write a program or library** in Accelerate and let us know about your
    experience. We want to make Accelerate both _fast_ and _usable_, so having
    more libraries, examples, benchmarks, and experience reports is a great way
    to help us achieve this. If you like, we can include a link to your work on
    the [libraries](/libraries.html) or [examples](/examples.html) pages, which
    also helps other users and helps the community grow.

  * **Submit a bug or feature request** to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues).
    Tried to write a program and encountered a bug? Have an idea for a new
    feature? Think some part of the language or library should be easier to use
    than it is? Please let us know!

  * **Write a patch** and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
    Anything from fixing a typo or improving comments and documentation, to
    implementing new compiler passes or
    [backends](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues/338) is
    appreciated.

  * **Improve this website** by submitting a pull request to the [website
    repository](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/acceleratehs.github.io). Most of
    the website content is written in
    [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), so no experience
    building websites is required.

  * **Swing by and say "hi"**. It always feels good to know that people are
    using the tools that we are working hard to improve <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
