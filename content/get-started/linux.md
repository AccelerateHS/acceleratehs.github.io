Get Started
===========

_Accelerate_ is a language for data-parallel array computations embedded within
the programming language [_Haskell_](https://www.haskell.org). More
specifically, it is a deeply embedded language. This means that when you write
programs with Accelerate, you are writing a Haskell program using operations
from the Accelerate library, but the method by which the program runs is
different from a conventional Haskell program. A program written in Accelerate
is actually a Haskell program that generates, optimises, and compiles code for
the GPU or CPU on-the-fly at program runtime.

To get started you will need to set up a Haskell environment as well as a few
external libraries.

## 1. Setup Haskell & LLVM

Selected operating system: **Linux**
