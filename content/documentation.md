Documentation
=============

Welcome to the documentation for the Accelerate language and compiler. To get
started, see the installation instructions on the [getting
started](/get-started.html) page or read how to [install from
GitHub](/get-started/install-from-github.html) to get the latest in-development
sources. Once the compiler has been installed, take a look at the [language
overview](/documentation/language-overview.html). More information about the
design and implementation of Accelerate can be found in our
[publications](/publications.html).

## External resources

  * [*Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell*](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929)
    by Simon Marlow is a book published by O'Rielly Media which covers several
    techniques for writing parallel and concurrent programs in
    Haskell, including a chapter on
    [programming with Accelerate](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/ch06.html).
    The book is available for purchase in electronic and paper formats, and can
    also be viewed online for free. Note that the API of Accelerate has changed
    slightly since the book was published, so we have written an
    [errata](/documentation/parallel-concurrent-programming-haskell-errata.html)
    containing changes and corrections.

  * The [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/documentation) website lists
    several books, courses, and tutorials to help you learn Haskell.
